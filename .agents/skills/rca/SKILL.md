Apply the Shell conventions from `AGENTS.md` before continuing (verify project-root CWD, capture `PROJECT_ROOT`, use absolute paths).

Args: $ARGUMENTS

Generate a customer-facing Root Cause Analysis (RCA) report for a ticket.

## Phase 0 - Resolve ticket

1. Run `/resolve-ticket-id $ARGUMENTS` inline; ID returned: `<ID>` = that value.
2. Otherwise, if `$ARGUMENTS` contains a `tickets/<name>/` path reference and that directory exists: `<ID>=<name>`.
3. Otherwise, if this conversation has already been working a specific ticket (its files were read
   earlier in this session, e.g. via `/investigate`): use that `<ID>`.
4. Otherwise: ask the engineer for the ticket ID (or its `tickets/<name>/` path) before proceeding -
   this report requires `tickets/<ID>/analysis.md` and can't be produced without a resolved ticket directory.

Save target: `tickets/<ID>/rca.md`.

## Your task

1. Read `tickets/<ID>/analysis.md` as your primary source of truth. Do not speculate or add
   information that is not grounded in the analysis or artifacts from this ticket directory.

2. If `analysis.md` is missing or incomplete, say so and ask whether to run `/investigate <ID>`
   first before proceeding.

3. If `tickets/<ID>/eir.md` exists, use it as an additional source - but remember the EIR is
   internal and must be translated appropriately for a customer audience.

4. Write the RCA in Markdown to `tickets/<ID>/rca.md`.

5. After writing the file, print the full contents of `rca.md` to the screen so it is ready to
   copy and paste into a Mattermost channel or ticket response, then print `Saved to: tickets/<ID>/rca.md`.

## RCA format

Use exactly this structure:

```markdown
# Root Cause Analysis — <one line description>

**Ticket:** <number>
**Date:** <date of incident>
**Severity:** <P1 / P2 / P3>
**Status:** <Resolved / Monitoring>
**Mattermost version:** <version>

---

## Summary

Two to three sentences. What happened, what was the impact, and what was
done to resolve it. Clear and direct — the customer should understand this
without reading further if they choose not to.

---

## Timeline

| Time (UTC) | Event |
|------------|-------|
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | <event> |

Include: when the issue began, when it was reported, when it was resolved.
Use confirmed timestamps only.

---

## Root cause

A clear, factual explanation of what caused the issue. Explain it in terms
of system behavior rather than fault or blame. Technical detail is
appropriate but should be accessible to a technical administrator, not
necessarily a developer.

---

## Impact

- **Scope:** <what was affected>
- **Duration:** <start to resolution>
- **Data loss:** <yes / no / none detected>

---

## Resolution

What was done to resolve the issue. Focus on the steps taken and the
outcome.

---

## Prevention

What is being done or recommended to prevent recurrence. Include any
configuration recommendations, upgrade guidance, or monitoring suggestions
that apply to the customer's environment.

---

*If you have questions about this report please reply to your support ticket.*
```

## Tone and style guidelines

**Write with confidence and professionalism.** This report represents
Mattermost to the customer. It should feel like it came from a team that
knows its product deeply and handled the situation competently.

**Specific tone guidance:**
- Factual and measured — describe what happened without dramatizing it
- Resolution-focused — emphasize what was done and what was learned, not
  what went wrong
- Avoid language that implies negligence, carelessness, or surprise —
  prefer "a condition was identified" over "we missed" or "we failed to"
- Avoid overly defensive or apologetic language — one brief acknowledgment
  of impact is sufficient, do not repeat it
- Do not editorialize — stick to facts, avoid phrases like "unfortunately"
  or "regrettably" repeated throughout
- Use passive or system-focused framing for the root cause where appropriate
  — "a misconfiguration in the TLS settings caused..." rather than
  "Mattermost incorrectly configured..."
- Active and confident voice for the resolution — "The support team
  identified and resolved..." not "it was eventually determined..."

**What to leave out:**
- Internal Jira or GitHub references
- Internal team names or individual names
- Any finding that is embarrassing without being relevant to the customer
- Speculation about causes that were ruled out
- Details about other customers or tickets

**What to never do:**
- Do not make commitments on behalf of Mattermost engineering (e.g. "this
  will be fixed in the next release") unless that is confirmed in the
  analysis
- Do not assign blame to the customer's environment or configuration without
  being tactful — "the observed behavior was consistent with a
  configuration where X is set to Y" rather than "the customer
  misconfigured..."
- Do not include customer-identifying information
